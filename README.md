# Applying Queuing Theory in Port Handling System
This repository hosts resources and findings from the project "Applying Queuing Theory in Port Handling System". The project focuses on the application of queuing theory to optimize operations at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), India's largest container port.

## Project Overview
The project aims to study the pattern of ship arrivals at JNPT and analyze the waiting and service times for optimization using queuing theory. The study also compares the existing handling services pattern at JNPT and suggests alternatives for improved efficiency.

## Key Topics Covered
Introduction to Queuing Theory and its relevance in port operations.
Overview of Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) and its operational dynamics.
Objective of the study, focusing on the pattern of ship arrivals and service times.
Data collection from JNPT's official sources and analysis using queuing models.
Application of Kendallâ€™s Notation in the context of port operations.
Comparison and analysis of JNPT with the container terminal at Alexandria seaport.
Conclusions drawn from the study and future recommendations.
